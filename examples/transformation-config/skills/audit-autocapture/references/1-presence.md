# Step 1 — Presence detector

This step decides whether the rest of the audit has anything to look at. Run it **before** any other work. Resolve zero ledger checks here unless the explicit-disable case below applies.

## Status

Emit:

```
[STATUS] Detecting PostHog autocapture configuration
```

## Action

Run **one `Grep` call** with `output_mode: "files_with_matches"`:

1. `posthog\.init\(|new PostHog\(|posthog\.Posthog\(|Posthog\(` — any PostHog initialization across runtimes (web, server, mobile, wrapper utils).

If init sites are found, `Read` each file once and inspect the init options for `autocapture` configuration. Record:

- Whether `autocapture` is set at all.
- Whether `autocapture: false` is explicitly set (disabled).
- Whether `autocapture: true` or `autocapture: { ... }` is explicitly set (enabled).
- Whether `autocapture` is unset (silently on for posthog-js, off for other SDKs).

## Decision

- **Grep returns zero hits anywhere in the project:** emit `[ABORT] No PostHog SDK initialization found` and stop. The wizard catches `[ABORT]` and terminates the run.
- **Init found, `autocapture: false` is explicitly set on every init site:** autocapture is fully off. Resolve all three Step 2 fix checks (`autocapture-intentional`, `autocapture-mask-config`, `autocapture-allowlists`) in a single `audit_resolve_checks` call with `status: "pass"` and `details: "skip: autocapture explicitly disabled in init config"`. Then continue to Step 3 — optimize-side checks still have work to do for the dead-clicks and ratio checks.
- **Init found, autocapture not fully disabled:** continue normally.

Do not call `audit_resolve_checks` for any other ids in this step. Do not preload future steps.

Continue to **`2-autocapture-fix.md`**.
