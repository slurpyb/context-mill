# PostHog events audit

This skill produces a product-browseable report of every PostHog event your code captures, mapped to the codebase area, and enriched with 30-day volume from PostHog.

## Workflow

The audit runs as a 6-step chain:

1. Detect SDK
2. Scan capture sites (grep only)
3. Enrich (subagent fan-out — the only step that reads source files)
4. Query PostHog for volume
5. Write report
6. Create dashboard

Each step file points to the next. Run them in order. Don't explore the source tree on your own.

**Start by reading `references/1-detect.md`** (relative to this skill's directory – typically `.claude/skills/events-audit/references/1-detect.md`). Don't read ahead. Don't re-read a step once you've passed it. Don't re-read SKILL.md.

Step 1 seeds the audit checklist as its first action. Don't assume the runtime pre-seeds it.

## The audit checklist

The audit checklist has three shared checks in addition to the event map audit: `identity-segmentation`, `coverage-map`, `data-quality`. Finish each one. Don't invent new ids.

The checklist lives at `.posthog-audit-checks.json`. It's owned by MCP tools – **never `Write` it directly**,

## The events inventory

A second file, `.posthog-events-inventory.json`, is the working event inventory for steps 2 through 4. It holds the capture sites with derived `package`/`area`/`route`/`enclosing` fields, event names, properties, and per-event volume from PostHog. 

It's **not** MCP-owned – no `audit_*` tool guards it. The inventory is **transient scratch state**, not a deliverable: step 5 deletes `.posthog-audit-checks.json` once the report is written, and step 6 deletes the inventory after the optional dashboard step. The report is the only artifact the user keeps.

Check entry shape:

- `id` - stable kebab-case slug. The three shared ids are `identity-segmentation`, `coverage-map`, `data-quality`.
- `area` - short group name. Shared entries use `Identity`, `Coverage`, `Data quality`.
- `label` - short human name.
- `status` - `pending` | `pass` | `error` | `warning` | `suggestion`.
- `file` - optional `path:line` for findings tied to a location.
- `details` - Markdown bulleted summary in plain language. Describe state and the product questions blocked. Don't render `status` as a grade in the report; the enum is for filter logic only.

## Key principles

- **Show your evidence.** Cite `file:line` for every non-pass finding.
- **Frame findings as product questions.** Every finding describes *what product question or insight it blocks*, not what code rule it breaks.
- **Hand the reader the map. Don't tell the story for them.** The deliverable is a single report with three short qualitative checks plus a few suggested follow-ups. The reader clusters events into flows on demand by asking targeted follow-up questions about the report — the skill doesn't do that synthesis upfront.

## Live activity – `[STATUS]`

The "Working on …" banner reads from `[STATUS]` lines you emit in plain text. Whenever you start a sub-step, write a line like:

```
[STATUS] Scanning capture sites
```

The wizard catches these and updates the spinner. Use them freely – they're cheap. Each step file lists the exact strings to emit. Don't invent your own.

## Abort statuses

Report aborts with `[ABORT]` prefixed messages. The wizard catches these and stops the run – don't halt yourself.

- `[ABORT] No PostHog SDK found`
- `[ABORT] No capture call sites found in any detected SDK`

MCP failures (project mismatch, query errors, no connection) are **not** abort conditions — step 4 soft-degrades and step 5 renders the report with a `{{mcp_disclaimer}}` callout in place of volume sections. See step 4 for the degradation contract.
