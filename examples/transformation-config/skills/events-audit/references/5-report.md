# Step 5 – Render the report

Produce the audit deliverable in a single pass. The report has three high-level views the reader scans first — Overview, Volume Map, Area Topology — followed by Identity & Segmentation, suggested follow-ups, and appendices.

The skill's job is to give the reader a map plus a few short observations. **Don't cluster events into flows. Don't write per-flow narratives. Don't synthesize a story.** The reader does that on demand.

## Supporting files

This step uses one supporting reference file (not part of the chain):

- `references/5-report-template.md` — verbatim markdown template for the rendered report. Orchestrator reads it once at step (f), substitutes every `{{placeholder}}`, and writes the result to `posthog-events-audit-report.md`.

## Output discipline

This is one report `Write`, not a write-then-read-then-rewrite cycle. Prior runs read their own freshly-written report 23 seconds after writing it and regenerated it — that wastes ~3 minutes of generation per cycle. Compose the entire Markdown in one model turn, then call `Write` once. If something is wrong with the result, fix it via `Edit` on the same file — don't `Write` it again.

Also: don't recap the inventory contents in assistant text before writing. Stream straight from the inventory you already read into the report.

## Status

Emit, in order:

```
[STATUS] Reading inventory
[STATUS] Computing volume map
[STATUS] Computing area topology
[STATUS] Computing overview KPIs
[STATUS] Analyzing identity & segmentation
[STATUS] Writing report
```

## Action

### a. Read the inventory

`Read` `.posthog-events-inventory.json` once. From it you'll work with:

- `rows[]` – capture rows (sorted by `volume_30d` desc by step 4) with `event_name`, `properties[]`, `package`, `area`, `route`, `enclosing`, `volume_30d`, `last_seen`, `status`, etc.
- `wrapper_undetected` – top-level boolean.
- `mcp_available` – top-level boolean from step 4. `false` means PostHog volume data is missing; render the report in degraded mode (see below).
- `mcp_skipped_reason` – optional short string explaining why MCP was skipped or failed. Used in the disclaimer when `mcp_available: false`.

If `rows[]` is empty, render a short report explaining the inventory is empty, resolve all three shared checks with `pending` details (no data to evaluate), and exit.

#### Degraded mode (`mcp_available: false`)

When MCP wasn't reachable in step 4, every row has `volume_30d: null` and `status: "pending"`. Render the report with these adjustments:

- Substitute `{{mcp_disclaimer}}` with a one-paragraph callout (see substitution conventions in (f)). Otherwise leave it empty.
- Volume KPIs in Overview render as `—` instead of numbers: total volume, phantom count, top-10 share. Distinct-events count still renders (it's code-derived).
- Volume Map section: instead of the events table, the body becomes a single line `_PostHog volume data was not fetched during this run — see the disclaimer above. Capture sites are still listed in the Area topology section below._`. Skip the capture-sites collapsibles too.
- Area Topology section: still renders, but sort areas alphabetically (no volume to sort by) and omit the `<total_volume>` figure from each area heading. Each event bullet shows just the event name plus `· conditional` if applicable; no volume number, no `· phantom` tag.
- Overview panels: skip "Volume concentration" and "Phantom events" entirely (both need volume). All other panels (no-properties, name drift, type drift, conditional fires, duplicate captures, unresolved dynamics) still render — they're code-derived.
- The `data-quality` check resolves to whatever the code-derived panels found. Don't penalize for missing volume; that's not a code problem.

### b. Aggregate by event (Volume Map records)

Group capture rows by `event_name` (skip rows where `is_dynamic == true` or `event_name == null`; those go to the dynamic-captures appendix). For each distinct event, compute:

- `event` – the literal name.
- `volume_30d` – pulled from any one row (rows for the same event share volume).
- `last_seen` – same.
- `status` – `resolved` | `phantom` | `pending` (from step 4).
- `capture_sites[]` – list of `{ file, line, package, area, route, enclosing }` for every row sharing this name.
- `areas[]` – distinct `area` values across the sites, alphabetical.
- `packages[]` – distinct non-null `package` values across the sites, alphabetical. Empty if all rows have `package: null`.
- `properties_seen[]` – union of all `properties[]` across the rows, sorted alphabetically.
- `has_conditional` – `true` if any contributing row has `conditional_fire == true`.

Sort by `volume_30d` desc; phantoms sink to the bottom. Compute `total_volume_30d = sum(volume_30d)` across all distinct events; per-event `share = volume_30d / total_volume_30d` for the Volume Map bars.

### c. Group by area (Area Topology records)

First, count the distinct non-null `package` values across all rows. Branch:

- **Multi-package monorepo (≥2 distinct non-null packages):** group two levels deep — `package > area`. For each distinct `package` (plus a `(unscoped)` bucket if any rows have `package: null`), tally per-area records inside it.
- **Single package or flat repo (0 or 1 distinct non-null package):** group flat by `area` as before.

For each `area` record (single-level or nested under a package), taking the first listed `(package, area)` per event when an event spans multiple — events appear once in topology, in their primary location — compute:

- `package` – the package bucket (only used in multi-package mode; `null` otherwise).
- `area` – the bucket name.
- `event_count` – number of distinct events in this area.
- `total_volume_30d` – sum of `volume_30d` for this area's events.
- `events[]` – the area's events, sorted by `volume_30d` desc, each carrying `event`, `volume_30d`, `has_conditional`, `is_phantom`.

Sort areas by `total_volume_30d` desc within their group; in multi-package mode, sort packages by their summed `total_volume_30d` desc.

If every event collapses to one or two `area` buckets (a flat repo), note this inline in the rendered topology section — the by-event table becomes the primary view.

### d. Compute Overview KPIs and panels

Overview is the action-oriented top section. It's a small KPI grid plus a series of issue panels.

#### KPIs (four numbers)

- **Total events (30d)** — `total_volume_30d` from (b).
- **Distinct events** — count of by-event records from (b).
- **Phantom (dead code)** — count of by-event records where `status == "phantom"`.
- **Top 10 = % of volume** — sum of the top ten events' `volume_30d` / `total_volume_30d`, rendered as a percentage. This is the concentration headline; high values (>95%) mean the long tail is mostly low-signal and a handful of events dominate ingestion.

#### Panels (zero or more, render only those that have content)

Each panel is a short bulleted list. Panels are derived deterministically from the inventory.

1. **Volume concentration.** A short text line plus the top 10 events as a bulleted list with bars. Each bullet: `event_name — Xk · share% · ▓▓▓▓░░░░░░`. Bars use Unicode block characters (`▓` for filled, `░` for empty), 12 chars wide, scaled to per-event share of `total_volume_30d`.
2. **Phantom events — in code, zero volume.** Events where `status == "phantom"`. Each bullet: `event_name — area`. Sort by area, then event name.
3. **No properties attached.** Events where `properties_seen[] == []`. Sort by `volume_30d` desc. Each bullet: `event_name — Xk events flying blind`. Limit to top 12; add `… (+N more)` if longer.
4. **Name drift — same concept, different keys.** Pairs of events whose names collapse to the same string when lowercased and stripped of underscores/spaces. Each bullet: `event_a vs event_b — splits funnels on <conceptual key>`.
5. **Type drift — numeric property with mixed types.** Property keys named `revenue`, `amount`, `price`, `count`, `duration_*`, `quantity` whose values mix number and string across call sites. Each bullet: `property — number at file:line, string at file:line — silently zeros aggregates`.
6. **Conditional fires — undercount risk.** Events where `has_conditional == true`. Each bullet: `event_name — fires inside <condition snippet> at file:line`. Sort by volume desc; cap at 8.
7. **Duplicate captures — same event from multiple SDK families.** Events present in both client- and server-side SDK rows, where neither row is in a test file and neither explicitly threads `distinctId` from request context. Each bullet: `event_name — fires from <SDK A> at file:line and <SDK B> at file:line — risks 2× counting`.
8. **Unresolved dynamic captures.** Inventory rows still flagged `is_dynamic: true` after step 3. Each bullet: `file:line — event name is <reason: function arg / template literal / network value>`.

Skip any panel whose source list is empty. Don't render an empty "No phantom events" header — silence is the signal.

These panels carry the findings that previously lived in the standalone Coverage Map and Data Quality sections; rendering them as Overview panels keeps action items in one place at the top of the report. 

The `coverage-map` and `data-quality` checks are still resolved separately via `audit_resolve_checks` (their `details` mirror the relevant Overview panels).

### e. Analyze identity & segmentation (shared check)

Reframe identity rules as product-facing capabilities. Identification works differently on the client and the server, so judge per SDK family detected in step 1.

#### Capabilities

1. **Cross-session tracking.**
   - **Client-side family present** (posthog-js, react-native, ios, android, flutter): pass if a `call_kind == "identify"` row exists with a stable user id as first arg (`session.user.id`, `auth.uid()`, JWT `sub`, or similar named variable — not a session-only id, not anonymous), and that identify row precedes the first `capture` row in the same file or auth boundary.
   - **Server-side family present** (posthog-node, python, ruby, go, php, dotnet, elixir): pass if **most** capture rows for that SDK have `distinct_id_kind == "variable"`. Server-side identification is per-call by design; an `identify()` row is **not** required. Fail if the dominant pattern is `"missing"` or `"literal"`.
   - **Both families present:** both branches must pass independently. If client identifies but server fires personless captures (or vice versa), users will appear as two distinct profiles — call this out.

2. **Plan-level breakdown.** Passes if any `set` / `set_once` row sets a `plan` (or `tier`, `subscription_tier`) person property; or `plan` appears in ≥1 capture row's `properties[]`.

3. **Org / team / workspace breakdown.** Passes if any `group` row exists with type `organization`, `team`, `workspace`, or similar.

4. **Cross-device tracking.** Passes if any `reset` row exists. Server-only projects skip this — the concept doesn't apply.

#### Rendering shape (Identity & Segmentation section)

Render as **bold lead** + one bold-leading bullet per capability + sub-bullets for granular evidence. **No prose paragraphs.** Every capability gets its own bullet — consistent shape across audits is what makes the section scannable.

```markdown
**<one-sentence dominant finding stated as product cost or affirmative outcome>**

- **Cross-session (client)** — <pass | partial | blocked>. <one-line evidence with file:line>.
  - <optional sub-bullet for non-obvious downstream impact>
- **Cross-session (server)** — <pass | blocked>. <one-line evidence>.
- **Plan / tier breakdown** — <pass | blocked>. <one-line evidence>.
- **Org / workspace breakdown** — <pass | blocked>. <one-line evidence>.
- **Cross-device hygiene** — <pass | missing | n/a>. <one-line evidence>.
```

If a capability doesn't apply, still emit the bullet with `n/a — <reason>`. Don't omit it.

#### Resolve all three shared checks

After computing the Overview panels in (d) and the identity capabilities in (e), call `mcp__wizard-tools__audit_resolve_checks` once for each shared check. Stream them as separate calls so the audit-plan tab updates progressively.

- `identity-segmentation` — status `pass` if all applicable capabilities pass, `warning` if cross-session is partial or one breakdown is blocked, `error` if cross-session fails. `details` mirrors the Identity & Segmentation rendering shape above.
- `coverage-map` — status `pass` (broad area distribution, no dark surfaces), `warning` (one or more dark surfaces, heavy reliance on `shared`, or wrapper-undetected), `suggestion` (coarse grouping). `details` is a short bullet list summarizing what the Area Topology section will show: distribution, dark surfaces, reliance on shared, wrapper-undetected, coarse-grouping. Cite `file:line` per non-pass bullet.
- `data-quality` — status `pass` (no Overview panels render), `warning` (one or two issue panels render), `error` (type drift, name drift on flagship events, or many phantoms). `details` mirrors the Overview panels that rendered: lead with the worst issue stated as product cost (e.g. "`revenue` type drift will silently zero out checkout aggregates"), then one bullet per issue.

### f. Render the report

The markdown report template lives in `references/5-report-template.md`. The orchestrator reads it once, substitutes every `{{placeholder}}` with values computed in steps (b) through (e), and writes the result to `posthog-events-audit-report.md` at the project root.

**Exception: `{{dashboard_callout}}` is intentionally not substituted in this step.** Step 6 fills that placeholder after dashboard creation runs. Leave it as-is in the rendered output — step 6 always resolves it (to a link on success, or empty string on failure), so it never ships to the reader.

#### Substitution conventions

These rules tell you how to format each placeholder. The placeholder names themselves are documented in the template's header comment.

- **`{{repo_name}}`** — the project root directory name.
- **`{{timestamp}}`** — short human-readable date (e.g. `2026-05-09`) or full ISO timestamp.
- **`{{mcp_disclaimer}}`** — empty string when `mcp_available: true`. When `mcp_available: false`, a one-paragraph callout. Use this exact shape, substituting `<reason>` from `mcp_skipped_reason`:
  ```markdown
  > **Volume data not fetched.** PostHog could not be queried during this run (<reason>). The events your code captures, where they fire, and how they're identified are still in the report below — but per-event 30-day volume, phantom detection (events seen in code but not in PostHog), and the top-events table are missing. Re-run the audit with PostHog MCP configured to populate them.
  ```
- **`{{total_volume}}`** — formatted with thousands separator (`310,000`) or compact (`310k`); use compact for totals ≥10,000. **Render `—` when `mcp_available: false`.**
- **`{{distinct_count}}`** — integer; from the by-event records in (b). Always renders (code-derived).
- **`{{phantom_count}}`** — integer; render as `0` if no phantoms (the row is still useful at all-zeros). **Render `—` when `mcp_available: false`.**
- **`{{top_10_share}}`** — percentage rounded to nearest whole, e.g. `90%`. **Render `—` when `mcp_available: false`.**
- **`{{overview_panels}}`** — concatenation of the panels from (d), each rendered as:
  ```markdown
  ### <panel title>
  - <bullet 1>
  - <bullet 2>
  ```
  Skip panels with no content. If every panel is empty, render the line `_No issues detected. Naming, types, and capture sites all look consistent._` instead.
- **`{{volume_map_rows}}`** — top 10–15 events from (b), one markdown table row each: `| # | \`event_name\` | volume | share | bar |`. Bar column uses a 12-char Unicode block: `▓` × `round(share × 12)`, padded with `░`. Phantom events sink to the bottom of the table; tag them inline with `· phantom` after the event name in the Event column.
- **`{{volume_map_footnote}}`** — one line stating how many events are in the table vs. total, plus a pointer to where the long tail can be found. Example: `Showing top 12 of 51 distinct events; the remaining events appear in the Area topology section below.`
- **`{{capture_sites_collapsibles}}`** — for each event in the volume map, one `<details>` block. Include `package <name>` in each site bullet only when the event's `packages[]` is non-empty (skip otherwise to keep single-package output uncluttered):
  ```markdown
  <details>
  <summary><code>purchase_completed</code> — 1,400 events / 3 sites</summary>

  - `apps/web/components/Checkout/Checkout.tsx:88` — package `web`, area `checkout`, route `/checkout`, enclosing `handleSubmit`
  - `apps/mobile/Checkout.tsx:44` — package `mobile`, area `checkout`, enclosing `onPaymentSuccess`

  Properties seen: `revenue`, `currency`, `plan`
  </details>
  ```
  Use HTML `<details>` so the report stays scannable but every site is one click away.
- **`{{area_topology_sections}}`** — for each area from (c). In single-package mode, render flat:
  ```markdown
  ### <area> (<total_volume> · <event_count> events)
  - `event_a` — Xk · conditional
  - `event_b` — Yk
  - `event_c` — Zk · phantom
  ```
  In multi-package mode, render nested under each package — the package header is `###`, area is `####`:
  ```markdown
  ### <package> — <package_total_volume> · <area_count> areas
  #### <area> (<total_volume> · <event_count> events)
  - `event_a` — Xk
  ```
  Use `(unscoped)` as the package header for rows with `package: null`. Annotations after the volume: `· conditional` if the event has `has_conditional`, `· phantom` if `is_phantom`. Both can stack.
- **`{{area_topology_commentary}}`** — one or two short bullets if the topology has notable shapes (e.g. "Auth events all live in `shared` — without a `source` property, you can't tell which page surface triggered each login"). Skip when nothing notable applies.
- **`{{identity_segmentation_details}}`** — the bold-lead-plus-bullets shape from step (e).
- **`{{dynamic_appendix}}`** — bulleted list of unresolved-dynamic rows: `file:line — <reason: function arg / template literal / network value>`.
- **`{{person_properties_appendix}}`** — bulleted list of person property keys from `identify` / `set` / `set_once` rows; deduplicate.
- **`{{groups_appendix}}`** — bulleted list of `group` rows: `<group_type>: <group_key>`.

#### Rendering rules

- **One `Write` call.** Compose the full substituted markdown in your turn before invoking `Write`. Don't pre-stream the content into assistant text.
- **Plain language, no grades.** Don't render the check `status` enum (`pass`/`warning`/`error`) as a badge or label in the report. Use prominence and word choice — a missing flagship capability leads its section; a nice-to-have is a footnote bullet.
- **`file:line` citations** on every non-pass observation.
- **Fan-out is not used in this step.** The data fits in one turn.

### g. Surface the deliverable and clean up the checklist

**Only one file is produced by this skill:** `posthog-events-audit-report.md`. **Do not write any additional summary, recap, or "what was done" file** (e.g. `posthog-audit-report.md`, `audit-summary.md`, `SUMMARY.md`). The single report from step (f) is the entire deliverable. Don't write an end-of-turn summary as a file — keep that in the chat reply only.

After the report is written and all three shared checks are resolved, delete the checklist file — it's a transient progress ledger:

```
Bash: rm -f .posthog-audit-checks.json
```

**Do not delete `.posthog-events-inventory.json` yet** — step 6 needs it for the IN-list. Step 6 cleans it up after the dashboard step, regardless of whether the user opts into dashboard creation.

Emit one trailing line so the wizard can surface the report to the user:

```
Created events audit report: <absolute path to posthog-events-audit-report.md>
```

## Resolve

`next_step: 6-dashboard.md`. By the end of this step, all three shared checks (`identity-segmentation`, `coverage-map`, `data-quality`) must be resolved via `audit_resolve_checks`. There are no per-flow checks to resolve. Step 6 handles the optional dashboard creation and the final inventory cleanup.
